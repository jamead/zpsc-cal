# ALS-U Power Supply Controller (zPSC) Calibration Code & Data 

David Bergman (dbergman@bnl.gov)


ALS-U zPSCs use either 18-bit or 20-bit digital to analog converters (DACs) for the power supply current setpoint reference and 18-bit or 20-bit analog to digital converters (ADCs) for readback of DCCT current measurements. Uncalibrated accuracy of zPSCs is at the level of 0.5 %. Calibrations of zPSC DACs and ADCs are performed at BNL to improve initial accuracy to the level of 20 ppm while providing tracability to PSC readback data and regulation accuracy. Averaging modes in the zPSC further reduce measurement noise in DCCT readback data which combined with calibrated accuracy and tracability confer levels of measurement performance approaching that of a laboratory 7.5 digit DMM.
