# ALS-U Power Supply Controller (zPSC) Calibration Code & Data 

David Bergman (dbergman@bnl.gov)


ALS-U zPSCs, a.k.a. PSCs, use either 18-bit or 20-bit digital to analog converters (DACs) for the power supply current setpoint reference and 18-bit or 20-bit analog to digital converters (ADCs) for readback of DCCT current measurements. Uncalibrated accuracy of PSCs is at the level of 0.5 %, so calibrations of PSC DACs and ADCs are performed to improve regulation and readback accuracy to the level of 20 ppm. In addition to calibrated accuracy, engineered stability, and traceability to accredited electrical standards, selectable averaging modes in the PSC further reduce measurement variation in DCCT readback data, conferring measurement capability to the PSC approaching that of a laboratory grade 7.5 digit DMM.
