David Bergman (dbergman@bnl.gov)


The bipolar power converter (BPC) developed for the Advanced Light Source Upgrade project (ALS-U) is a family of 4-quadrant power converters with rated power ranging from 720 W to 3.2 kW. BPCs
are switch-mode type, voltage-regulated power amplifiers conceived, designed, and built by
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to meet the tight physical space requirements of the ALS-U
accelerator complex.
